# Implementation of the CYK algorithm

A basic implementation a parser based on the CYK algorithm. This code can be used to understand how to use the CYK  algorithm to obtain a parse tree and eventually to develop a more complex parser. The result of the analyzis is a ParseTree object.

# Usage
Run the following command in a terminal with python 3 installed:

`python3 test.py <grammar_file> <sentence>`

Example: 
 
`python3 test.py grammar.cfg "I prefer the morning flight through Denver"`
